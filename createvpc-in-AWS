Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC service.

Click on "Create VPC" to begin the VPC creation wizard.

Enter a name for your VPC, and specify the IPv4 CIDR block that you want to use. 
This is the range of IP addresses that your VPC will use. For example, 
you could use the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 to create a VPC with 65,536 private IPv4 addresses.

Choose whether you want to enable IPv6 for your VPC. 
If you choose to enable IPv6, you will need to specify an IPv6 CIDR block as well.

Choose the VPC's tenancy.
By default, VPCs are created with the default tenancy, 
which means that the instances that you launch in the VPC will be shared with other AWS customers. 
If you want to launch instances with dedicated hardware, you can choose the "Dedicated" tenancy option.

Click "Create" to create your VPC. 
Once the VPC is created, you will be redirected to the VPC dashboard.

Now that your VPC is created, you can create subnets,
route tables, security groups, and other resources within the VPC to define the network topology and security rules.
